I have just made an executable command line tool to make it easy to install and use.



A Swift-based command-line tool to **rename an Xcode project** throughout its folder structure â€” including `.xcodeproj`, `.xcworkspace`, schemes, folders, and internal references.

The tool is packaged as `xprename`, and can be installed via Homebrew or built locally.

## ðŸš€ What Does It Do?

Renaming an Xcode project isn't just renaming a folder â€” it often involves:

- Renaming the `.xcodeproj` file  
- Renaming the `.xcworkspace` file (if present)  
- Renaming scheme names  
- Renaming directory names  
- Updating internal references to the old name in:
  - `project.pbxproj`
  - `workspace` data files
  - `.swift` or `.plist` files (if desired)

`xprename` automates all of this safely and quickly in a single command.

## ðŸ“¦ Installation (via Homebrew)

You can install the command-line tool using Homebrew:

```bash
brew tap stewartlynch/tap
brew install xprename
```

Once installed, run the tool from the root of your project:

```bash
xprename OldProjectName NewProjectName
```

## ðŸ›  Manual Build & Install (Locally via SwiftPM)

If you prefer to build it yourself, you can clone the repo and install the tool manually using Swift Package Manager.

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/StewartLynch/XcodeProjectRenamer.git
cd XcodeProjectRenamer
```

### Build with SwiftPM

```bash
swift build -c release
sudo cp .build/release/xprename /usr/local/bin/
```

Now you can run:

```bash
xprename OldProjectName NewProjectName
```

---

## ðŸ§ª Example

```bash
xprename MyOldAppName MyNewAppName
```

This will:
- Rename all references of `MyOldAppName` to `MyNewAppName`
- Rename `.xcodeproj` and `.xcworkspace` files
- Update folder names and scheme names accordingly
